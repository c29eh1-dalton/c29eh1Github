		hello this is a link to my journal page.
	<br><br>

	lets go back to the <a href="untitedunmastered.html">home page</a>

<P>Journal Entry 1:</P>
	<P>Date: 10/30/25</P>
<P1>Linked together all my pages and finally figured out the link to the youtube video. I dont really have much to say so im gonna give a quote to fill up space. "You cant control the winds, but you can always adjust the sails". Thats a cold quote imo😎.</P1>

<P>Date: 11/20/25</P>
<P>finally back at it, been gone for a while  but now its time for another quote. "Just because yall are on the same team, doesn't mean they want you to win, same goal, different misson". Another cold quote imo😤.</P>
